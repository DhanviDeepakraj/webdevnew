    <h1>Astrophotography</h1> 
    <p>
      Astrophotography is the art and science of capturing images of celestial objects, cosmic events, and the night sky. It blends astronomy with photography, allowing us to see the universe in stunning detail—from the bright glow of the Moon to distant galaxies millions of light-years away. What the human eye cannot see in real-time, astrophotography reveals through long exposures, advanced optics, and digital processing.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the rise of digital cameras and mobile technology, astrophotography has become accessible to beginners as well as professionals. Even with simple equipment like a smartphone and tripod, one can capture star trails or the Milky Way under a clear, dark sky. Advanced astrophotographers use telescopes, tracking mounts, and specialized cameras to photograph nebulae, planets, and galaxies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Astrophotography is not just about beauty—it also contributes to science. Amateur and professional astrophotographers often help record rare cosmic events, track asteroid movements, or study the surface details of the Moon and planets. These images inspire curiosity and provide a deeper connection with the cosmos.

    <h2>Types of Astrophotography</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Wide-Field Astrophotography</b> – Capturing constellations, the Milky Way, and star trails using regular cameras and wide lenses.</li>
      <li><b>Planetary Photography</b> – Taking close-up images of planets, the Moon, and sometimes the Sun (with proper filters).</li>
      <li><b>Deep-Sky Photography</b> – Photographing galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters using telescopes and long exposure techniques.</li>
      <li><b>Time-Lapse Photography</b> – Recording the motion of stars, auroras, or eclipses over several hours.</li>
      <li><b>Aurora Photography</b> – Capturing the northern and southern lights in vivid colors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Famous Examples in Astrophotography</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>The Orion Nebula (M42)</b> – One of the most photographed deep-sky objects.</li>
      <li><b>The Andromeda Galaxy (M31)</b> – Our nearest major galaxy, visible even with small telescopes.</li>
      <li><b>The Milky Way Core</b> – A breathtaking target in wide-field astrophotography.</li>
      <li><b>Lunar Surface</b> – Craters and mountain ranges captured in high detail.</li>
      <li><b>Planetary Images</b> – Close-ups of Jupiter’s bands, Saturn’s rings, or Mars during opposition.</li>
    </ul>

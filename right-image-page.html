        <b>NASA’s Artemis II spacecraft named “Integrity”</b> – NASA's Artemis II mission, scheduled for February 2026, will be the first crewed lunar mission since Apollo 17. 

        The Orion spacecraft for this mission has been named "Integrity" by the crew to reflect core values such as trust, respect, and humility, honoring the global team behind it. 

        During its 10-day voyage around the Moon, Artemis II will test life-support and navigation systems in preparation for the Artemis III lunar landing mission.

        <b>NASA taps startup to save aging Swift Observatory</b> – NASA has partnered with a startup to prevent the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from decaying into Earth's atmosphere. 

        The startup will develop a mission to dock with the satellite and boost it to a higher orbit, extending its operational life. 
        Swift Observatory, which monitors gamma-ray bursts and other cosmic events, has been in orbit since 2004 and continues to provide valuable data.

        <b>NASA selects 10 new astronaut candidates</b> – Out of more than 8,000 applicants, NASA has selected six women and four men for its new astronaut class. 

        These candidates will undergo rigorous training over the next two years, preparing for future missions to the Moon, Mars, and low-Earth orbit. 
        This selection continues NASA's efforts to diversify and expand its astronaut corps.
